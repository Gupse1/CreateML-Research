# CreateML-Research
The playground that contains the easy ways to start your journey with **CreateML** and is a part of the [CreateML blog post](https://www.netguru.co/codestories/createml-start-your-adventure-in-machine-learning-with-swift). The demo app [Healthy Luncher](https://github.com/netguru/HealthyLuncher-Demo) was also created for the purpose of this research. With its help it is possible to check out how the models work.

In this Playground you can create a model for:
- **Image**
- **Text**
- **Tabular Data**

classifications.

It also contains a set of needed training & testing data for **classification of lunch - whether it was healthy or fast food**. *As for the images - Open Images v4 dataset and Google pictures with an option 'labeled for reuse' were used*.
